                <p>This is random text of me that will go beside the image and will ultimately become a paragraph of the stuff about me as well so I am just going to keep typing until this text starts to wrap</p>
                <p>Here is some more stuff that will contain information about me as it pertains to the basic portfolio. I will continue to input more information</p>
                <p>This is the last bit of the paragraph about me and I doubt there is even much to say at this point but oh well I guess I will just continue to type</p>
